# Are-Extreme-Sports-Actually-Safer-Than-We-Think-

## Project Overview
This project uses data analysis to challenge common assumptions about risk by comparing the fatality rates of skydiving to everyday activities such as driving, biking, and swimming. Although skydiving is often perceived as an “extreme” and highly dangerous activity, this analysis demonstrates that it is statistically safer than many activities people engage in daily.

By examining fatality rates, age-based risk patterns, and media coverage, this project highlights how fear and perception—rather than data—often shape public understanding of risk.

## Research Question
Are activities labeled as “extreme,” such as skydiving, actually more dangerous than everyday activities like driving?

## Data Sources
- **United States Parachute Association (USPA)**  
  Annual safety reports providing skydiving fatality rates.
- **CDC WONDER & CDC WISQRS**  
  Public health databases used to obtain fatality data for driving, biking, swimming, and age-based injury statistics.
- **New York Times Article Archive**  
  Used to compare media coverage of skydiving fatalities versus driving fatalities.

All data was standardized to **2023** to ensure consistency across sources.

## Methodology
- Compared fatality rates per 100,000 occurrences for skydiving and driving
- Analyzed driving fatality risk by age group and compared it to skydiving risk
- Extended comparisons to other common activities (biking, swimming)
- Used clustering techniques to group activities by relative risk levels
- Visualized results using comparative bar charts, age-based plots, and scatter plots
- Analyzed media coverage frequency to examine how rare events influence public fear

## Key Findings
- The skydiving fatality rate in 2023 was **0.23 per 100,000 jumps**, compared to **12.9 per 100,000 people** for driving.
- Driving is riskier than skydiving across **all age groups**, including the safest driving years.
- When grouped by annual risk, driving was classified as the **highest-risk activity**, while skydiving, biking, and swimming fell into a lower-risk cluster.
- Media coverage disproportionately emphasizes rare skydiving accidents, contributing to inflated public fear despite lower statistical risk.

## Interpretation
The analysis demonstrates that perceived risk often diverges from actual risk. Skydiving, while dramatic and emotionally charged, is a highly regulated activity with controlled risk. Driving, by contrast, is an uncontrolled, behavior-dependent activity that poses significantly greater danger.

This project illustrates how data can be used to separate emotion-driven fear from evidence-based risk assessment and encourages more rational decision-making around everyday dangers.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Public health and safety datasets (CDC, USPA)

## Project Format
This project is presented as a data-driven op-ed supported by visualizations and statistical comparisons, emphasizing clear communication of analytical findings to a general audience.

## Notes
This analysis focuses on relative risk and perception rather than advocating for specific behaviors. The goal is to demonstrate how data can correct common misconceptions about danger and safety.
